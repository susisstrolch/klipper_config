# Klipper configuration (FLSUN QQ-S pro) for stepper with tmc2209 stepper driver

#uart_pin:
#tx_pin:
#select_pins:
#interpolate: True
#run_current:
#hold_current:
#   The amount of current (in amps RMS) to configure the driver to use
#   when the stepper is not moving. The default is to use the same
#   value as run_current.
#sense_resistor: 0.110
#stealthchop_threshold: 0
#   The velocity (in mm/s) to set the "stealthChop" threshold to. When
#   set, "stealthChop" mode will be enabled if the stepper motor
#   velocity is below this value. The default is 0, which disables
#   "stealthChop" mode.
#uart_address:
#   The address of the TMC2209 chip for UART messages (an integer
#   between 0 and 3). This is typically used when multiple TMC2209
#   chips are connected to the same UART pin. The default is zero.
#driver_IHOLDDELAY: 8
#driver_TPOWERDOWN: 20
#driver_TBL: 2
#driver_TOFF: 3
#driver_HEND: 0
#driver_HSTRT: 5
#driver_PWM_AUTOGRAD: True
#driver_PWM_AUTOSCALE: True
#driver_PWM_LIM: 12
#driver_PWM_REG: 8
#driver_PWM_FREQ: 1
#driver_PWM_GRAD: 14
#driver_PWM_OFS: 36
#driver_SGTHRS: 0
#   Set the given register during the configuration of the TMC2209
#   chip. This may be used to set custom motor parameters. The
#   defaults for each parameter are next to the parameter name in the
#   above list.
#diag_pin:
#   The micro-controller pin attached to the DIAG line of the TMC2209
#   chip. The pin is normally prefaced with "^" to enable a pullup.
#   Setting this creates a "tmc2209_stepper_x:virtual_endstop" virtual
#   pin which may be used as the stepper's endstop_pin. Doing this
#   enables "sensorless homing". (Be sure to also set driver_SGTHRS to
#   an appropriate sensitivity value.) The default is to not enable
#   sensorless homing.
