[adxl345]
cs_pin: adxl345:PA4
#spi_speed: 5000000
#   The SPI speed (in hz) to use when communicating with the chip.
#   The default is 5000000.
spi_bus: spi1
#spi_software_sclk_pin:
#spi_software_mosi_pin:
#spi_software_miso_pin:
#   See the "common SPI settings" section for a description of the
#   above parameters.
#axes_map: x,y,z
#   The accelerometer axis for each of the printer's x, y, and z axes.
#   This may be useful if the accelerometer is mounted in an
#   orientation that does not match the printer orientation. For
#   example, one could set this to "y,x,z" to swap the x and y axes.
#   It is also possible to negate an axis if the accelerometer
#   direction is reversed (eg, "x,z,-y"). The default is "x,y,z".
#rate: 3200
#   Output data rate for ADXL345. ADXL345 supports the following data
#   rates: 3200, 1600, 800, 400, 200, 100, 50, and 25. Note that it is
#   not recommended to change this rate from the default 3200, and
#   rates below 800 will considerably affect the quality of resonance
#   measurements.
# === ADXL345 as Z-probe ===
probe_pin: adxl345:PA3
#   Pin on the printer MCU that the accelerometer is connected to as a
#   Z probe. Setting this pin enables the functionality of ADXL345
#   working as a Z probe. All parameters below are enabled only if
#   probe_pin is set. Disabled by default.
int_pin: int1
#   Either int1 or int2; the pin on the ADXL345 that will be connected
#   to the probe pin on the printer MCU. By default, int_pin is high when
#   probe is triggered and low otherwise; this behavior can be changed
#   by using `!int1` or `!int2` respectively, in which case the int_pin
#   is low when triggered and high otherwise. If probe_pin is set, this
#   parameter must be provided.
#tap_thresh: 5000
#   Acceleration threshold in mm/sec^2; when the accelerometer exceeds
#   this acceleration during probing for at most tap_dur seconds (see
#   below), it will consider that it hit the printer bed, triggering
#   the probe. The default is 5000 mm/sec^2, which may be too sensitive
#   for many printers.
#tap_dur: 0.01
#   The maximum duration of a 'tap' during probing. If the acceleration
#   exceeds tap_thresh for at most tap_dur during probing, this will
#   trigger the probe endstop. The default is 0.01 sec.
#bed_probe_point: 0,0
#   X, Y coordinates of a point to test the bed offset. Used by
#   `BED_OFFSET_CALIBRATE` command. The nozzle height prior to
#   probing can be set via `horizontal_move_z` parameter.
z_offset: 0.0

#samples_result:
samples_tolerance: 0.15
samples_tolerance_retries: 5
#horizontal_move_z:
