[firmware_retraction]
retract_length: 4.5
#   The length of filament (in mm) to retract when G10 is activated,
#   and to unretract when G11 is activated (but see
#   unretract_extra_length below). The default is 0 mm.
retract_speed: 35
#   The speed of retraction, in mm/s. The default is 20 mm/s.
unretract_extra_length: 0
#   The length (in mm) of *additional* filament to add when
#   unretracting.
unretract_speed: 35
#   The speed of unretraction, in mm/s. The default is 10 mm/s.

[verify_heater extruder]
heating_gain: 10
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must increase
#   by when approaching a new target temperature. The default is 2.
check_gain_time: 999999
#   The amount of time (in seconds) that the heating_gain must be met
#   in before an error is raised. The default is 20 seconds for
#   extruders and 60 seconds for heater_bed.
hysteresis: 10
#   The difference between the target temperature and the current
#   temperature for the heater to be considered within range of the
#   target temperature. The default is 5.
max_error: 120
#   The maximum temperature difference a heater that falls outside the
#   target temperature range may accumulate before an error is
#   raised. For example, if the target temperature is 200, the
#   hysteresis is 5, the max_error is 120, and the temperature is
#   reported at 185 degrees for 12 seconds then an error would be
#   raised (or 24 seconds at 190, or 120 seconds at 194, etc.). The
#   default is 120.
